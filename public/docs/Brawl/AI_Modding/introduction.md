# AI Modding

AI modding has been an area that is usually seen as mysterious and extremely daunting.  As one might guess, the default AI of modded characters is often *pretty terrible*. While certain things might *work*, that just happens by chance.

This series of pages will teach you everything you need to know about AI modding.

> extracting and compiling AI scripts to/from the fighter files is windows-only. However, you should still be able to use the tools to work on the text-based files if you so desire.

## Philosophy

there are a lot of design choices to make when it comes to creating an AI. If there were no limits to what you could do, what would you go for? For me, that is one of the most exciting things to think about. This guide will ultimately contain the knowledge necessary to develop an AI using the basic tools that Brawl gives you, but if you continue reading past the basics and look into [Falconbot](/Brawl/AI_Modding/Falconbot/Philosophy) and you will see how I go about making them in my own way.
